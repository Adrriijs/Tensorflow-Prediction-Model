# TensorFlow Student Performance Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts **student exam scores** using **machine learning models** including:
- **Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Linear Regression (LR)**

It uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** for feature importance analysis.
