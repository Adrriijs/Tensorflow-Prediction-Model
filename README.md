🚀 **Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project builds a **student performance prediction model** using **machine learning techniques**. The model is trained on a dataset of student exam scores and uses multiple approaches for prediction.

## 🔍 Dataset: Student Performance
The dataset contains features related to students' academic performance, including:
- **Study hours, parental education level, test preparation course, and more**
- The goal is to predict students' **final exam scores**

## 📚 Features of this Project
